	<h1>Donate to the BHG Server Fund</h1>
	<h2>(Also known as the Buy Koral A New Bike Fund)</h2>
	<div class="donate">
		<h2>Paypal</h2>
		<p>Those with paypal accounts. I can not accept direct CCs through Paypal. They want
		money per month for that.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="donate">
		<h2>Paymate</h2>
		<p>Use this if you just want to donate with a CC without setting up a Paypal account.</p>
	</div>
	<p>Keeping the server up and running is an expensive and time consuming proposition. Until
	2004 I had been funding it all myself, at the time it was costing me US$109, approximately
	10% of my after tax take home pay. I could not keep this up, so started looking for donations.
	Now the server is cheaper US$69 a month and considerably more powerful.</p>
	<p>So feel free to donate as little or as much as you want. And remember donate and you
	get the contributors access to the <a href="http://www.lyarna.net/">free hosting</a>.</p>
