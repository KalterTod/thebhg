When the nanites come into contact with substances other than the wearer they emit an energy current. The Nanitic Fist is great in melee combat because of the damage caused to organic material by the electricity and because it will be a surprise since the nanites take the color and texture of the wearer\'s hands. The gloves can also electrify any metallic weapon. The only drawback is the tendancy of the electric current to actually fry some of the nanites. This can be a major problem, because some users have reported having the nanites to go haywire and begin devouring the flesh it is attached too.

Sonic weapons generated a wide-dispersal cone of high-intensity sound, but there disadvantage is that it will not work in space because sound does not travel through space. There are two settings on sonic weapons one that produces a blast of sound equal to that of a blaster shot and the other is a setting that causes the cones vibrations to become powerful enough to cause devastating injuries. The stun setting causes a high-pitched wail that disrupts equilibrium and causes a loss of balance and unconsciousness, but this setting has to be reset for every species. Sonic weapons have limited ranges and the Sg-82 rifle has a maximum range of 35 meters and an optimum range of 15 meters, which also makes them perfect for crowd control. The only ammunition needed for sonic weapons is a standard power pack. The sonic projector and sound emitter precisely control the width of the sonic cone, to be able to affect a single target or a group of beings within a ten meter range. Sonic weapons are very useful under water where blasters fail, because the water amplifies the sonic blasts many times over, because waters sound-conducting qualities. During the Galactic Civil War Imperial aquatic assault squads carried sonic rifles. There is another disadvantage which is that there are some armors that have sound-absorbing and dampening layers, and since the relative rarity of sonic weapons this means these measures are not widely used.','-1','-1','4',125000);

The design of the E-11 is a light wieght model that is well-balanced that is allows accurate one-handed firing, which allows the soldiers to use the weapon in close quaters as easy as one would use a blaster pistol. The extended sighting stock, advanced galven circuitry, and computer-enhanced scope, which filters out smoke, haze, and enhances vision in low-light conditions, make the E-11 good at long-range targeting. The E-11 has a maximum range of 300 meters and an optimum range of 100 meters, which is almost nearly three times the range of a blaster pistol, this is because of the barrel which runs almost the entire length of the weapon. To accomodate the barrel design the actuating blaster module, and prismatic crystal housing are located behind the barrel, while other components are mounted to the side or underneath the galven circuitry, and the gas chamber uses an unique design that raps around the back of the barrel. The E-11 is equipped with a force-feed liquid cooling agent that is called a freelol, this prevents the blaster rifle from dangerous heat buildups. The side mounted power pack has enough energy for 100 shots, and the blaster rifle itself can use this energy in a variety of power levels, from stun to full blast. The large quarter-centimeter bore, allows the E-11 to be quite leathal at its full power setting. Both Imperial and New Republic forces normally use the semiautomatic setting to conserve ammunition and to allow adequate cooling, the E-11 can be set on full automatic or pulse fire, but extended automatic fire may throw the barrel out of allignment. The E-11 was sold to the Galactic Empire exclusively during the Galactic Civil war but the Rebel Alliance managed to aquire thousands of E-11\'s through the black market and outright theft. The E-11 and the SoroSuub-manufactured blaster rifle called the Stormtrooper One (later renamed the Freedom One. Also the SoroSuub blaster rifle was a technological "clone of the E-11.) were and still are favorites of both Imperial and New Republic forces. Other military blaster rifle models that are frequently used by the military include: The SoroSuub Heavy Tracker 16, The Merr-Sonn G8, and the very powerful BlasTech A280, but none of these weapons matches the versatility or reliability of the E-11.','-1','-1','4',20000);

The bowcaster is a magnetic accelerator with twin polarizers that use alternating polarity pulses to accelerate a highly tensile metal bowstring and propel an explosive at extremely high speeds. The projectile that is fired has the apperance of an energy blast because it is rapped in an energy field that helps the projectile explode. Great strength is need to cock the weapon, and the primitive aming system limits the bowcaster\'s rate of fire and places great emphasis on the Wookiee\'s patience and markmanship. Some Wookiees like to modifie there bowcasters by adding multiple bowstrings or duel bows, or in Chewbacca\'s case an automatic recocking system. Also during the Imperial occupation of the Wookiees home world of Kashyyyk the Wookiees often bolted their blaster rifles to their bowcasters to provide added fire power against enemies. The bowcaster is deisgned for use in Kashyyyk\'s dense forests with enough fire power to take down the most dangerous enemies, but the bowcaster is a short-range weapon with an optimum range of 30 meters and a maximum range of 50 meters. The bowcaster can be dissassembled and carried in a utility pouch, and can be put back together in less than a minute. Wookiee\'s use bandoliers to carry power packs, canisters of blaster gas, and spare ammunitiob cartridges that hold six quarrels each. The bowcaster is hand-built by the master weapon crafters of Kashyyyk, and the bowcaster is then bestowed to young Wookiee\'s as they are completing adulthood rites of passage. This tradition has endured for thousands of years, and the warriors bowcaster is considered a visible symbol of his or her courage and honor, these are highly prized possessions and are often engraved with clan markings and pictographs depicting a warrior\'s greatest accomplishments.','-1','-1','4',40000);

Imperial soldiers often used them to flush Rebels out of hidding in there base. A single flame blast from a flame projector can cause tremendous damage to enemy equipment and vehicles, and fuel burns for several minutes. Most Imperial soldiers and Corporate Sector Authority security police ("Espos") use flame projectors frequently to break up civilian demonstrations and enforce martial law on rebellious worlds. Space pirates like to use flame projectors as boarding weapons. Flame projectors come in a wide variety of sizes and capabilities that range from Boba Fett\'s wrist-mounted Czerka ZX unit to the deadly flame carbines and rifles favored by military forces. Boba Fett\'s flame projector produces a cone of flame up to five meters long and a meter wide, and the backpack fuel canister supplies him with over fifty shots.

Being in the area of a White Dwarf will produce a white glow, whereas being near a Red Giant will produce a red glow. The only drawback is that the power supply can only be charged by solar energy, so you must be under a natural sun to charge the weapon.
