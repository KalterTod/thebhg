INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

1. Open up news-config.php
   Work through all the settings found within untill it is
   configured how you want. Instructions are within the file
   itself.

2. Once configured upload news-config.php and ctable.php to
   your web space. Open ctable.php in a browser. ie:
     http://underlord.thebhg.org/news/ctable.php
   This will create the necessary tables within your
   database.
   An error will mean you have not configured the system
   properly.

3. Once the table is created you should delete ctable.php
   from your webspace.

4. The script comes with a very basic news layout in
   news-layout.php. You can edit this file to make the news
   layout consistant with your web site. There are a few
   tags you need to place within this file to get it to
   display the news properly, other then this the file is
   standard html.
     %topic%    -  The topic of the news article.
     %message%  -  The main body of the news article.
     %date%     -  The date on which the article was 
                   posted.
     %email%    -  The email address of the person that
                   posted the article.
     %name%     -  The Name and Position of the person
                   that posted the article.

5. Next you need to set up the layout for the display
   number of pages section. This has one tag that goes
   in where you wish the form to be displayed.
     %display%

6. Within the page where you want the news to be displayed
   include the line:
     <?php include("news.php"); ?>
   This file must have an extension that will cause the
   server to run PHP commands, in most cases this is .php

7. Once all this is done, upload the file that displays the
   news, news.php, news-config.php, news-layout.php,
   news-display-layout.php, news-functions.php and
   news-admin.php to the same directory on your server.

Congratulations, you should now have the BHG News System
installed on your site. You should be able to post news
to the system using news-admin.php now.
