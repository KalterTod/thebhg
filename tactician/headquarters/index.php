				<h2>Welcome to the Tactician Towers.</h2>
				<p>Bounty Hunter; I must welcome you to the Towers.
				  This is the very heart of the Bounty Hunter's Guild, a powerful, results driven organization of the best
				  mercenaries, assassins, and tactical minds the galaxy has to offer. My name is <a href="http://holonet.thebhg.org/index.php?module=roster&page=hunter&id=<?=$judicator->GetID()?>" title="View the roster profile for Tactician <?=$judicator->GetName()?>"><?=$judicator->GetName()?></a> and
				  I am the leader of Tactician Towers. Designed to provide a combination of fun
				  and functionality like the previous Kabal Authority, the Tactician Towers 
				  combines the best hunting technology in the galaxy with the best entertainment 
				  credits can buy. Within the Tower, you can find anything from restaurants to shops,
				  and anything inbetween, on the entertainment end. If you're looking for work, the 
				  Tower also has what you crave. The only requirements is that you act in accordance 
				  with Guild Policy once inside. Shooting a lowly minion in the Tactician's Workforce
				  is an easy way to get yourself a one way ticket to the La Roche Orbital Prison, or 
				  to parts unknown. That's if the Tactician is feeling generous and doesn't just execute
				  you on the spot.</p>
				  <p>Situated in downtown Gawain, Tactician Tower rises a glistening dagger-shaped skyscraper suited for the headquarters of the Tactician. Within the seventy-five stories of Tactician Tower are all the offices and equipment necessary to assist the Tactician in carrying out his job. The first five stories comprise the lobby. The lobby is very elegant yet understated enough to impress the visitor while still maintaining a businesslike theme. Restaurants and shops that cater to the Tower's workers are situated around the edges of the lobby.</p>

<p>The next 5 stories are conference rooms and public meeting areas which are used when missions need to be handed out, when the public wishes to speak with some from the Tactician's Office, or for planning upcoming events. The largest room in these floors is The Briefing Room. The Briefing Room is infamous for the large amount of hidden weapons used by the Tactician to kill Trainees when handing out missions. It is large enough to seat the entire population of the Guild if need be.</p>

<p>The next twenty stories of the building contain the working spaces of the many staffers who maintain the Bounties and Missions. These people slave away tracking down bounties, gathering information about them, ensuring payments are transferred and conducting primary investigation. The activities the general populace of the BHG takes for granted could not happen without these people.</p>

<p>The next five stories contain the headquarters for the Cadre Games. Rosters, events and rules are all maintained here. The five stories after those are the headquarters of the Kabal Authority, the department of the Office of the Tactician that bring you the KAGs and used to bring you the KAC.</p>

<p>The 41st and 42nd stories comprise the Competition Headquarters. It is from this area that the Tactician oversees any competition that is running at the moment. Up to the minute scores and progress are available on giant holoscreens. Admission to the center itself is limited to Chiefs and higher, but normal hunters can sit in galleries and watch what is going on.</p>

<p>No one really knows what is on the next three levels... rumours persist that there is a secret prison of sorts for personal prison of the Tactician there, but that has not been verified.</p>

<p>Above the three unknown levels are two hangers that take up five total stories of space. There is usually plenty of room to park the ships of all that wish to visit the Tactician for whatever reason, but on special occasions parking is at a premium and is assigned on the basis of seniority and rank.</p>

<p>The next 20 stories make up a sort of ultra-exclusive club, bar, and hotel for the elite of the Guild. Plush suites, attractive members of the sex and species you like, and lots of booze are available for the favoured here. The Tactician is happy to provide for those that do his bidding. The fianl five levels consist of a personal office, working space, penthouse and hanger for the Tactician himself.</p>

<p>While certainly not the largest building in Gawain, the building serves the needs of the Tactician admirably. It is protected by several banks of Auto-Blasters on the ground to protect from terrestrial threats and by several banks of turbolasers on the tops of nearby buildings to defend from any aerial threats.</p>
