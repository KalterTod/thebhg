<B>About
Online Missions</B>
<BR><BR>

<U>What
is an online mission?</U>

<BR><BR>

To
quote the online mission manual: <I>The original
Mission Type, missions of Type Aurek are text-based mysteries which
contain all clues needed to solve them in the text of the mission. As
such, your ability to correctly answer these missions will directly
rely upon your general Star Wars/BHG knowledge and/or your ability to
thoroughly analyze the potentially cryptic passages contained
therein. </I>

<BR><BR>

That's
pretty much it.
<BR><BR>

<U>How
do I solve an online mission?</U>

<BR><BR>


Read the mission, look for
clues, give an answer. That sounds rather glib, but that really is
about all there is to it.

<BR><BR>


If you're having trouble with
every mission, I'd suggest going back through the archive and reading
as many missions as you can. They (usually) have the answers and an
explanation of how to derive the answer from the mission itself
attached, and they can be good practice.

<BR><BR>

<U>Why
are some missions really hard?</U>

<BR><BR>


Different authors tend to
write different types of mission. Some authors are good at difficult,
brain-twisting missions, others tend to write easier ones. This sort
of variety is generally something that is good for missions. In
addition, individual missions by the same author are often quite
different in terms of difficulty and style as well, since this keeps
it interesting for the author as much as the reader.

<BR><BR>

<U>Do
I have to give a reason?</U>

<BR><BR>


No. An answer alone is enough.

<BR><BR>

<U>How
do I get the 50k bonus for good reasoning?</U>

<BR><BR>


Generally speaking, write a
good explanation of how you have arrived at your answer. Usually, the
best three to seven will get a bonus.

<BR><BR>


Alternatively, you can just
make the Tactician laugh, which will also get you a bonus. It's
harder than it sounds, though.

<BR><BR>

<U>Is
there anywhere to view individual answers?</U>

<BR><BR>


Not at present. The Tactician
has been toying with creating a hall of fame for funny answers for
some time, but hasn't yet gotten around to it. It can't really be
done automatically because of the offensive nature of some answers.

<BR><BR>


<B>Writing Online Missions</B>

<BR><BR>


<U>How do I submit an online
mission?</U>

<BR><BR>


Send it to the Tactician as a
text file or Word document, preferably the former if you're not using
any special formatting.

<BR><BR>


<U>Why don't I get notified if
my mission isn't used?</U>

<BR><BR>


The Tactician tried writing
notes for all submissions for one mission set. Unfortunately, most
sets have between five and fifteen missions submitted, and writing
good notes takes about half an hour per mission, so there just isn't
the time.

<BR><BR>


<U>I've had a couple of
missions not used. Do you hate me?</U>

<BR><BR>


No. Your best bet is probably
to write a mission or two for your kabal first; chiefs tend to be
grateful for activities created by others, and chances are you'll get
some feedback and will improve as a writer.

<BR><BR>


<U>Can I use pictures in an
online mission?</U>

<BR><BR>


Yes. You'll probably need to
submit the mission as a Word document in that case.

<BR><BR>


<U>Can I use content usually
prohibited by the Code of Conduct in online missions?</U>

<BR><BR>


To some extent, yes. Missions
with possibly unsuitable content may still be accepted, but will get
a warning on them when posted. There has been one mission accepted
since Jernai became Tactician which has fallen into this category, so
it is possible.

<BR><BR>


Having said that, though, it
is strongly recommended to stick to the CoC. Preference will be given
to missions that do obey the Code, and particularly graphic missions
will be completely ignored.

<BR><BR>


<U>Do I get a reward for
creating lots of missions?</U>

<BR><BR>You do. The current
rewards are as follows (missions are only counted from mission set 34
onwards, and must be accepted and appear on the site):

<BR><BR>


3 OMs: 100k and a Lyarnan
Crest
<BR>
6 OMs: 200k and a Silver Plate
<BR>
9 OMs: 300k and a Gold Plate
<BR>
12 OMs: 500k and a Brand of
Honour
<BR>
Beyond that: No-one is there
yet, although Simon's determined to find out what is at 15 OMs, it
seems. The truth is that the Tactician has no idea yet.

<BR><BR>


<U>Any other tips?</U>

<BR><BR>


Check your spelling and
grammar. Nothing annoys Tacticians more than having to correct that,
and poor spelling or grammar will usually result in your mission
being rejected.

<BR><BR>


Also, you may only rely on the
reader knowing about the BHG and Star Wars movies. Other. You may not
assume any knowledge of other subgroups and Star Wars novels.

<BR><BR>

<B>Audio
OMs</B>

<BR><BR>


<U>What is an audio OM?</U>

<BR><BR>


An audio OM is much the same
as a regular OM, just in audio. You can find the only audio OM
created to date in the mission archive under mission set 28.

<BR><BR>


<U>Will there be further audio
OMs?</U>

<BR><BR>


Hopefully. They're extremely
time-consuming to write and create, but there is one being worked on.

<BR><BR>


<U>When will it be out?</U>

<BR><BR>


An excellent question.

<BR><BR>


<B>Site Information</B>

<BR><BR>


<U>Didn't this used to look
different?</U>

<BR><BR>


<A HREF="http://tactician.thebhg.org/">http://tactician.thebhg.org</A>
has gone through many changes over the years, since every Tactician
seems to change the design. This pattern will probably continue when
Jernai is inevitably fired some day.

<BR><BR>


<U>What happens to my answers
once submitted? Are they automatically marked by the code?</U>

<BR><BR>


No. Your answers are stored in
a database, and the Tactician goes back through the answers at the
end of the mission set and marks them correct or incorrect and
decides whether to award the 50k bonus or not.
