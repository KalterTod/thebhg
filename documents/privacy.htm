<h1>Bounty Hunters Guild Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>The Bounty Hunters Guild (<a href="http://www.thebhg.org/">thebhg.org</a>) 
is committed to respecting the privacy rights of all visitors to our Web site 
in accordance with industry standards and the <i>Children's Online Privacy 
Protection Act (COPPA)</i>, effective as of April 21, 2000. By using this site,
you signify your acceptance of the Bounty Hunters Guild Privacy Policy detailed
herein. If you do not agree with this policy, do not provide any personally 
identifiable information to us or do not use the Web site.</p>

<p>The Bounty Hunters Guild only collects personally identifiable information
given expressly by its members, visitors to this Website and/or interested 
parties for internal use. The Bounty Hunters Guild will not disclose, provide 
or sell this information to any third party or use it in any way, except where
necessary, to meet obligations of legal compulsion.</p>

<p>We may collect the name of a child or parent and online contact information 
in order to obtain parental consent to parents of kids under 13 or to provide 
parental notice. If a visitor indicates that he/she is under the age of 13, 
HE/SHE WILL BE ASKED TO SUPPLY A PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S E-MAIL ADDRESS. In 
this case, the parent or guardian will receive an e-mail message containing 
instructions on how to enable the child's club membership and until the parent
or guardian enables the child's registration, they will not be a member of the
Bounty Hunters Guild. If we do not receive the parent's or guardian's said consent
within a reasonable time, we delete this information from our records. We also 
may collect this information to respond to a specific request from a child 
under 13. Once we respond to a request from a child under 13, we may not 
contact your child again and the information is deleted from our records.</p>

<p>You can always ask us to review or delete any of your child's information 
at any time by sending us a written request at the Contact Information below 
and you can ask that we do not use or collect any more personal information 
from your child. However, if you ask us to delete your child's information 
that is necessary to participate in our activities, we may have to ask your 
child not to participate in our activities.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change or remove this privacy policy at our discretion.
If we decide to change our privacy policy we will post those changes here. We encourage
you to visit this area frequently to stay informed. We will tell you via e-mail (and/or post a
notice at  <a href="http://www.thebhg.org/">www.thebhg.org</a>) if we make any material changes
in how we collect, use or we wish to share your information in any manner not previously
authorized by you or your parent.</p>
