				<h2>Welcome to the Kabal Authority</h2>
				<p>Bounty Hunter; I must welcome you to the Kabal Authority Headquarters.
				  This is the very heart of the Bounty Hunter's Guild, which as you know is
				  a subsiduary of the Emperor's Hammer. My name is <a href="http://holonet.thebhg.org/index.php?module=3&page=hunter&id=<?=$judicator->GetID()?>" title="View the roster profile for Judicator <?=$judicator->GetName()?>"><?=$judicator->GetName()?></a> and together
				  with my assistant, <a href="http://holonet.thebhg.org/index.php?module=3&page=hunter&id=<?=$proctor->GetID()?>" title="View the roster profile for Proctor <?=$proctor->GetName()?>"><?=$proctor->GetName()?></a>,
				  we run the Kabal Authority; with some help from each kabal's chief. Not only
				  does the Kabal Authority provide a source of entertainment and activity for
				  each hunter, but it also houses the best bounty hunter's in the known galaxy
				  for focused, specialized training. But know this; before you dare to enter,
				  you must agree to abide by our governing rules here at the BHG, as set forth
				  by the Emperor's Hammer Strike Fleet. Failure to comply with these rules
				  will result in your execution, no questions asked.</p>
				<p>Stationed on the planet of Meyu, this headquarters is perfect for
				  hunters to dwell in. Very unstable conditions occur without warning and are
				  extremely violent, including hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunder storms. The
				  sky is constantly covered by a thick veil of clouds so dense, that shadow
				  blankets the whole moon of Ravouin. To avoid these unpredictable weather
				  conditions, the Kabal Authority Headquarters was constructed underground.
				  It is powered by natural subterrainian geothermal energy, and uses an artificial
				  light source for most of its chambers, particularly the main hallway. This
				  weather makes for ideal training and honing of the skills vital to any bounty
				  hunter's progress.</p>
				<p>Take a look around; this is your new home. Feel free to go anywhere
				  you choose, though be warned - you will not encounter many friendly Hunters
				  within these walls. As I am sure you are aware, we are considered the scum
				  of the galaxy - both ironically and inversely, we are among the richest of
				  all its people. The order of the galaxy would not be upheld so smoothly,
				  should we be removed from it.</p>
				<p>Much of this complex is dedicated to the soul purpose of guiding and
				  teaching initiate hunters, but I'm sure even the most seasoned of you will
				  find the contained information most beneficial. We have several resources
				  for you to view: resources that can answer many of your queries. As you explore
				  this facility, keep in your mind the effervescant memories of those that
				  have gone before... those that have made this guild what you can envisage
				  before you now. Without them, we wouldn't be here now...</p>
				<p>Take with you now our sincere wishes of success as we send you on
				  your way to becoming a great and influencial bounty hunter, who, like those
				  who have gone before you, will be remembered and revered by the generations
				  that follow in your footsteps. Good luck, and may the force be with you.</p>
