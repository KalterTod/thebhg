<div><h2>Section XIII: Xerokine Outlet Center</h2>
<p>The <font color=#FF0000>Xerokine Outlet Cetner [XOC]</font> is a bounty hunter’s one-stop shop for everything they need. Named after a large contributor to its manufacture, the XOC houses six stores, which are known as <font color=#FF0000>Subdivisions</font>. Each one is specially designed to sell items of a specific nature, from starfighters to robots to weapons. Here is a list of all the Subdivisions and a short description about each:
</p>
<blockquote><a href="http://mall.thebhg.org/ssl/" target="_blank">Stalker Shipyards Limited [SSL]</a>
<br>The SSL is the official shipyards of the Bounty Hunter’s Guild, specializing in the sale of ships and parts for these ships. You can purchase starfighters, freighters, and even hybrids, a mix between the two.
</blockquote>
<blockquote><a href="http://mall.thebhg.org/kiw/" target="_blank">Khan Industrial Weapons [KIW]</a>
<br>KIW is a subdivision that deals exclusively with personal weaponry. Chemical weapons, energy weapons, explosives, melee weapons, modifications, and more are available here. Start building your arsenal here.
</blockquote>
<blockquote><a href="http://mall.thebhg.org/kke/" target="_blank">Kal-Ket’s Entrepot [KKE]</a>
<br>An entrepot is "a place where goods are stored or deposited and from which they are distributed." KKE sells non-combative items of every nature, from action figures to animals and even candy. This is where you can let loose and have fun shopping!
</blockquote>
<blockquote><a href="http://mall.thebhg.org/dsm/" target="_blank">Darth Shadow Manufacturing [DSM]</a>
<br>The BHG’s armory, DSM makes its products to the highest quality standards and using some of the rarest materials known in the galaxy. If you need that extra level of protection, you will find it at DSM. From common leather to the finest Mandalorian alloys, they have the armour to suit just about any hunter's needs.
</blockquote>
<blockquote><a href="http://mall.thebhg.org/rgt/" target="_blank">Royal Ground Transport [RGT]</a>
<br>You can fly around in starfighters, but what happens when you land? The RGT sells ground vehicles of every type. Whether you need to get somewhere fast or you just want to cruise around in style, RGT has what you need.
</blockquote>
<blockquote><a href="http://mall.thebhg.org/krf/" target="_blank">Koral Robotics Foundry [KRF]</a>
<br>Droids, droids, and more droids! Just as the name implies, the KRF sells robots to aid the hunter in specialized areas. If you can’t do something, then let your robot do it. Or perhaps you just want someone to talk to...
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, as a Trainee, you need to focus on SSL, because one of your graduation requirements is to purchase ship from there.
</p>
<p>As you might have noticed, each Subdivision is named after a Hunter who has contributed their time and effort to the BHG, making it what it is today. While the items you purchase at the XOC are mainly used in RP activities and any fiction you might write, there is still a lot of fun in purchasing items for yourself. Take a look around all of the Subdivisions and get to know what they have to offer. Many times the Tactician will release a special item for purchase that is limited in availability. There are also Special Edition items that far exceed the quality of any other item.
</p>
<p>This is where you get to spend those hard-earned credits, so make the most of it!
