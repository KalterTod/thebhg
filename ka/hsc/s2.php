<div><h2>Section II: Getting Started</h2>
<p>The BHG <a href="http://holonet.thebhg.org/" target="_blank">Holonet</a> should be the first place you stop on your path to becoming a Hunter. You visited this site at least once when you filled out the form to join the Bounty Hunters Guild; it holds all the information about every Hunter in the BHG, both active and inactive. Here are the different modules housed by the Holonet and brief descriptions of each:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://holonet.thebhg.org/index.php?module=holonet&page=index" target="_blank">Holonet News</a><br>News about updates to the site</li>
<li><a href="http://holonet.thebhg.org/index.php?module=library&page=index" target="_blank">Library</a><br>Houses all official manuals, texts, and Citadel course notes; as well as the Quote Archive and Timeline</li>
<li><a href="http://holonet.thebhg.org/index.php?module=roster&page=index" target="_blank">Roster</a><br>Contains all hunter information, Commission reports, and the administration section, which we will get into shortly</li>
<li><a href="http://holonet.thebhg.org/index.php?module=mb&page=index" target="_blank">Medal Board</a><br>Displays all the medals and who has received them</li>
<li><a href="http://holonet.thebhg.org/index.php?module=boloball&page=index" target="_blank">Boloball</a><br>A gambling activity that will be discussed in another section of the Head Start Center</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a quick moment now and click on the link to the <a href="http://holonet.thebhg.org/index.php?module=library&page=index" target="_blank">Library</a> section of the Holonet. Look at the right-hand column of links that fall under the heading <font color=#FF0000><i>Books</i></font>. Click on the first link under <font color=#FF0000><i>Main Shelf</i></font> entitled <font color=#FF0000><i>Hunter’s Manual</i></font>. This is the main manual of the Bounty Hunters Guild; it is where you will find most of the information needed for the CORE Exam. Bookmark it.
</p>
<p>Now we are going to set up your personal roster page. You should have no problems if you follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up the <a href="http://holonet.thebhg.org/" target="_blank">Holonet</a> web site if you haven’t done so already.</li>
<li>Click on the link that says <font color=#FF0000><i>Roster</i></font>. (It’s between <font color=#FF0000><i>Library</i></font> and <font color=#FF0000><i>Medal Board</i></font>.)</li>
<li>Under the Roster link you just clicked on, a new line of links should have appeared. Click on the last one called <font color=#FF0000><i>Administration</i></font>.</li>
<li>The right side of your screen should now display an <font color=#FF0000><i>Admin Menu</i></font>. Underneath that will be the heading <font color=#FF0000><i>Personal Details</i></font>. Click the link directly below that called <font color=#FF0000><i>Edit My Details</i></font>.</li>
<li>You should now see a form with the heading <font color=#FF0000><i>Roster :: Administration :: Edit My Details.</i></font> Most of the fields should be self-explanatory. Here, though, are a few notes on some of them:
<ul>
<li><b>Name:</b> What you go by in the BHG. This field must be completed.</li>
<li><b>E-Mail Address:</b>  Your e-mail address that BHG information will be sent to. If this isn’t correct, fix it now or chance missing out on important e-mails.</li>
<li><b>IRC Nicknames:</b> This is a list of all the nicks you use on IRC, a program covered under the "Communications" section of the HSC.</li>
<li><b>Quote:</b> This can be any quote that you like or that pertains to your BHG persona.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When you have completed the form to your satisfaction, click the button <font color=#FF0000><i>Save Details</i></font>. You should get a confirmation message. Next click on <font color=#FF0000><i>Edit My IPKC</i></font> under the Admin Menu.</li>
<li>The form you see now will display the entered information on your <font color=#FF0000>IPKC [Imperial Peace-Keeping Certificate]</font>. More information about the IPKC can be found in <a href="http://holonet.thebhg.org/index.php?module=library&page=chapter&id=3" target="_blank">Hunter’s Manual, Chapter 4</a>.
<br><b>NOTE:</b> The <font color=#FF0000><i>Face Image URL</i></font> field is used to link to an online picture of your BHG persona. If you don’t have a picture, don’t worry. You can add one later.</li>
<li>Once you have filled out all the information you wish to on this form, click the button <font color=#FF0000><i>Save IPKC</i></font>. You should see another confirmation message displayed.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, you have filled out all the information that is necessary to start off right in the BHG. As you probably noticed, there are two other links under <font color=#FF0000><i>Personal Details</i></font> that we didn’t get into. <font color=#FF0000><i>Change My Password</i></font> is self-explanatory, and <font color=#FF0000><i>Edit My Character Sheet</i></font> will be discussed later in the <a href="<?php echo $PHP_SELF; ?>?op=hsc&sect=12">Activities</a> section. Like always, if you have any further questions about this, do not hesitate to ask your Warden!
