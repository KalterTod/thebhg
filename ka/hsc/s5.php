<p>The above statement could not be truer. <font color=#FF0000>Imperial Credits [ICs]</font> are the currency of the Star Wars Universe, and you should be aware by now that the main driving force behind the Bounty Hunter profession is wealth. This means ICs play a vital role in the structure of the BHG. Credits determine a Hunter’s rank and, of course, what he or she can purchase to increase his or her arsenal.
</p>
<p>Before you continue along the Head Start Center, you must be aware of this fact: there are two different IC account for each Hunter in the BHG. The first and probably most important account displays the number of Credits earned by the Hunter since joining the BHG. With that in mind, this account will only increase. This amount will determine what Rank you hold in the BHG; therefore, we call all the Credits in this account <font color=#FF0000><i>Rank Credits</i></font>, also known as <font color=#FF0000><i>Earned Credits</i></font>. There are only a certain situations in which one will ever see this amount decrease, for example a demotion as the result of a punishment.
</p>
<p>The second account is known as <font color=#FF0000><i>Spending Credits</i></font>. In the terms of a role playing environment, this is your character’s actual <font color=#FF0000><i>Account Balance</i></font>. For every Rank Credit you earn a Spending Credit is added to your account; hence, if you have not spent any Spending Credits, then your Rank Credits and Spending Credits will be equal. In most cases your Spending Credits will be less than your Rank Credits. You can use Spending Credits to purchase items from the Xerokine Outlet Center and for gambling.
</p>
<p>We will discuss gaining and using ICs at later points in the HSC; although, hopefully you have gained a little understanding about how important Imperial Credits are to the BHG.
