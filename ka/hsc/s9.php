<p>In the last section, you learned about the BHG Commission members. If you read the <a href="http://holonet.thebhg.org/index.php?module=library&page=chapter&id=2" target="_blank">Hunter’s Manual, Chapter 3</a>, then you would know that the <font color=#FF0000>Judicator [JUD]</font>, with the aide of the <font color=#FF0000>Proctor [PR]</font>, oversees the <font color=#FF0000>Kabal Authority [KA]</font>. As you probably read in Section IV, the Kabal Authority houses all the <font color=#FF0000>Kabals</font> in the BHG. The Kabal is the basic structural unit in the BHG, and each one is unique. Here is the link to the Kabal Authority web site as well as a list of the Kabals, which includes each Kabal’s Chief, CRA, slogan, and other information:
