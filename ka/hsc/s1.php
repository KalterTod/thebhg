<div><h2>Section I: BHG Overview</h2>
<blockquote>"The Emperor's Hammer is an organization of online Star Wars gaming fans founded in December 1994 and is dedicated to recreating the excitement and adventure of the Star Wars saga online.  The Emperor's Hammer is primarily based on the TIE Fighter (LucasArts, 1994 and 1995), Dark Forces (LucasArts, 1996), X-Wing (LucasArts, 1993 and 1994), X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter (Lucasarts, 1997), Jedi Knight (LucasArts, 1997), Rebellion (LucasArts, 1998) and XWing Alliance (LucasArts, 1999) game platforms and takes place in the   Star Wars Universe following the Battle of Endor.  However, we also have several   SubGroups which allow interested Imperial Citizens to join our cause without owning any computer game simulations or playing EH-Member designed games (i.e. Conquest, Diplomacy, etc.).
<br>
<br>"The Emperor's Hammer is an UNOFFICIAL Star Wars related organization, supported entirely by its Members which has been the primary reason for its continued phenomenal growth rate. The goal of the Emperor's Hammer is to foster interactive participation from its Members to create an "online" Star Wars experience unprecedented on the Internet. Through the distribution of regular Newsletters, the Emperor's Hammer provides a publishing and distribution platform for its Members' submissions...As a result of this policy, the organization has rapidly become the premiere Star Wars organization on the World Wide Web (WWW)."

<p>As a member of the <font color=#FF0000>Bounty Hunters Guild [BHG]</font>, you are automatically a member of the <font color=#FF0000>Emperor’s Hammer [EH]</font>. As you just read, the EH is an online Star Wars club for fans of all kinds. Literally thousands of people from around the world have joined the EH to interact with each other surrounded by a common interest. With such a high membership count, the EH relies on a team of members to act as the <font color=#FF0000>Command Staff [CS or EHCS]</font>. Led by Fleet Commander (and founder of the EH) Grand Admiral Ronin, the EHCS is the core of the EH, maintaining order and thus a safe environment in which to have fun. To learn more about all the members and advisors of the EHCS, visit:

<blockquote>"The Emperor's Hammer consists of the main TIE Fighter Corps and its supporting Subgroups.  Each of these groups within the Fleet typically represent gamers using a different game platform and also a different function within the club.
<br>
<br>"The Emperor's Hammer Strike Fleet has NINE "SubGroups" for those Imperial Citizens that wish to join the Empire but don't own the TIE Fighter, XWing vs TIE Fighter or XWing Alliance (LucasArts, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1999) computer games.  Each Subgroup specializes in a different facet of the Star Wars of the Dark Side/Imperial Universe."

<p>The BHG is just one <font color=#FF0000>Subgroup [SG]</font> of the Emperor’s Hammer. Of which you should already be aware by now, we are the bounty hunters – scum – of the EH. We handle the dirty jobs and look to Imperial Credits as our reward. You will expectantly learn much more about the BHG from the rest of this Head Start Center; however, if you wish to learn about other SGs within the EH, follow this link:

</ul>
<p>In order to maintain a safe and fun environment for all of the EH’s members, several rules and regulations have been set forth. These are very important to know and understand, because the violation of any of these rules can result in punishment by the <font color=#FF0000>High Court of Inquisitors [HCI]</font>. Some members have even been permanently expelled from the EH and are considered "Most Wanted," meaning they can have no contact of any kind with the EH. I highly advise that you take the time to read the following documents to avoid any infractions:
