<div><h2>Section III: Graduating the Citadel</h2>
<p>Now that you have learned a little bit of background about the EH/BHG and have set up your Roster page, you are ready to start working on advancing your BHG career. As I am sure you are aware, you are the lowest rung on the ladder right now. Trainees don’t get much, if any, respect within the BHG until they get out of the Citadel as Hunters; therefore, it is in your best interest to get out of the Citadel as quickly as possible. In order to graduate from the Citadel and become a Hunter, you must fulfill only two requirements.
</p>
<p>The first requirement is passing the <a href="http://citadel.thebhg.org/exams/take/core" target="_blank">BHG Core Exam</a>. This exam has been designed to test whether or not you have the basic knowledge needed to continue on in the BHG. Most of the information needed to pass this exam will be covered in the Head Start Center; however, you will also need to read the Hunter’s Manual and understand all of the information in that. Here are a few links to resources that should be very helpful to you in completing the Core Exam:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://holonet.thebhg.org/index.php?module=library&page=book&id=1" target="_blank">Hunter’s Manual</a></li>
<li><a href="http://holonet.thebhg.org/index.php?module=roster&page=current-staff" target="_blank">Current Staff</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, it is in your best interest to aim for 100% on the Core Exam. You only need a grade of <u>75% to pass</u>, but if you get 100% then you will be awarded the <font color=#FF0000>Scholar’s Crossbow (SCB)</font>, a medal that you can proudly add to your ID line.
</p>
<p>The second requirement is to purchase a ship from <font color=#FF0000>Stalker Shipyards Limited [SSL]</font>.* In order to do this, you should first familiarize yourself with the <font color=#FF0000>Xerokine Outlet Center [XOC]</font>. There are quite a few divisions of the XOC that you will eventually want to check out; however, your main focus right now should be the purchasing of a ship. Remember that a Hunter cannot effectively do his job without his own personal ship. Here are the links to the XOC and SSL:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mall.thebhg.org" target="_blank">Xerokine Outlet Center</a> [XOC]</li>
<li><a href="http://mall.thebhg.org/ssl/" target="_blank">Stalker Shipyards Limited</a> [SSL]</li>
</ul>
<p>There are five sections of the SSL web site that you should be aware of first. If you look at the links at the top of the page, you will easily find them. The first thing you should be aware of is the <font color=#FF0000>Hull Catalog</font>. In this section of the SSL you can purchase empty hulls of ships. Each one is unique, but none are flyable without the installment of proper <font color=#FF0000>Modifications</font>. Notice in the statistics of each hull the places were Modifications can be attached - these are called <font color=#FF0000>Bays</font>.
</p>
<p>Now move on to the <font color=#FF0000>Modification Catalog</font>. You should notice right away that there are a lot of options to choose from. Thankfully, every Modification (or Mod) is placed under a specific category along with other Mods of the same type. If you wish to create your vessel from an empty Hull, use the Mod Categories as a step-by-step process in which to ensure that you have everything you need.
</p>
<p>The next section we will look at basically puts the other two together. The <font color=#FF0000>Ship Catalog</font> is where you will find completed ships that do not require any further Mods, but still may have room for any additions you would like to add. If you have already completed the Core Exam, you will have at least 100,000 <font color=#FF0000>Imperial Credits [IC]</font> sitting in your account. This exactly matches the price of a <a href="http://mall.thebhg.org/ssl/ship.php?id=11" target="_blank">S/A 43 "Hammerhead" Fighter</a>, so feel free to look at that as a purchase option. Otherwise, you will probably have to start out by purchasing a Hull. Remember, though, if you want a better ship, then you will have to do activities to earn enough Imperial Credits to purchase it. We will discuss more of what Imperial Credits are for later in the Head Start Center.
</p>
<p>Your next stop in the SSL is the <font color=#FF0000>Registry</font>. Clicking on this link will display a list of Division links within the BHG, such as the <font color=#FF0000>Kabals</font>, <font color=#FF0000>Citadel</font>, and even <font color=#FF0000>Retirees</font>. By clicking on any of these links, you can see what the members of each Division currently own in the SSL. Click on the <font color=#FF0000><i>Citadel</i></font> link and see who currently owns a ship and who doesn’t. You probably don’t have a ship next to your name, which means that you need to start thinking about what your first purchase will be.
</p>
<p>Finally, if you have any questions about anything within the SSL, check out the <font color=#FF0000>FAQ</font> page (that’s Frequently Asked Questions for those who may not know). If your question is not in there, feel free to e-mail your Warden or the Marshal, and they should be able to help you.
</p>
<p><i>* Please note that according to BHG policy, members of the BHG are not authorized to give SSL Ships to any Trainees within the Citadel. Any ships transferred, unless sold via auction, will be immediately deleted from the registry without compensation.</i>
