</B></U></FONT>
<P>Greetings,</P>

<P>This guide has been designed to align all the individual Kabal RO activities under the main BHG RP Umbrella. Now, while this may seem restrictive in some areas, it has been decided that with the many different Kabals the main RO system has been altered and changed to the degree to where some of the newer hunters try to participate in the main RO systems, they end up either being penalized, or removed altogether from participation because they have not followed the rules. Now, admittedly the rules have not been posted publicly for anyone to read or follow, that will be changed. On the Adjunct’s Office site, there will be a BHG RP handbook posted for all to read and follow.</P>

<P>I am all in favor of the Kabals having their own RP activities, however when they are run differently and the newer hunters get confused on the rules because &quot;that was not how it was done in my Kabal&quot;, it now becomes my responsibility to bring the RP system into uniformity. This handbook will do that.</P>

<B><P>Overall RO rules:</P>
</B>
<OL>

<LI>Time limits: All RO events should be no longer than 30 days. They can be as short as a week, but no longer than a month. After that amount of time, the story becomes too involved for any newer hunter to just &quot;jump right in&quot;. </LI>

<LI>Participation: Any and all hunters may participate in any Kabal RO event at any point of time (as long as they belong to the Kabal, of course), unless the Chief / CRA has a valid objection. Character Sheets are optional, but not a requirement (that decision rests with the Chief / CRA presiding over the event).</LI>

<LI>Adjunct’s Privilege: This actually extends to cover the entire Commission, however, this clause enables the Adjunct to participate in, overview, and/or stop any Kabal RO event at any time if a rules violation is discovered. Now, while shutting down an activity is the worse case scenario, it needs to be included for the CoC ‘s and the BHG rules. More detail will be included later in this handbook.</LI></OL>


<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Kabal RO rules are as follows:</P>

<P>*30-day time limit maximum. </P>

<P>*Character Sheet recommended, not required.</P>

<P>*Chief or CRA <B>must</B> start and run the activity. Others may submit the topic, but the CRA/Chief must start the topic.</P>

<P>*The Chief / CRA must grade the activity as well. </P>

<P>*No consecutive posts by any hunter.</P>

<P>   <I>Now, this rule has some leeway, depending on the circumstance. A particular hunter may be allowed to post consecutively if the story has stagnated, but that option may be used based on the following criteria:</P>
<P>   *There is a 5-day gap between posts.</P>
<P>   *It is necessary to complete the RO (meaning the story was at a vital point and a consecutive posting would re-vitalize it / finish it.</P>

<P>The RO may only have <B>one</B> consecutive posting per event. If it is used early and the story grows stale, you have no other option.</P>
</I>
<P>*The RO must be posted on the Kabal main MB for all to see. This helps newer hunters see what is transpiring and may generate activity. </P>

<P>*All EH and BHG rules of conduct apply.</P>

<B><P>Rewards:</P>
</B>
<P>Credits: No more than 3000 ic’s per post, unless the post is of exquisite quality. There are exceptions to the rule, but if you want to award more based on quality, please allow the Adjunct to read the post and make the determination.</P>

<P>Experience Points: Those are decided by the Adjunct alone. If you feel XP has been earned by a particular hunter, please contact the Adjunct to read the RO and determine XP awards.</P>

<P>Medals: This is a gray area… How this is handled in the main RO is based on points. A set number (or target number) of points to complete the RO is determined at the start of the RO. Any hunter gaining the point requirement &quot;wins&quot; the RO. Now the high scorer of the RO can, if the Chief agrees, has the potential to award a medal to the high scorer of the activity. This is for the high scorer<B> only</B>.</P>

<P>For hitting the target number, a Lyarnan Crest is the usual award.</P>
<P>30% above the target earns a Silver Plate.</P>
<P>50% above the target earns a Gold Plate.</P>

<B><P>Grading:</P>
</B>
<P>Start the post at maximum credits / points of 3000. </P>

<P>-2 points for each simple mistake </P>
<P>-5 points for each moderate mistake </P>
<P>-10 to –30 points for each major mistake </P>
<P>-300 to –500 points for each Blatant Error</P>

<P>Simple mistake: Slight spelling errors, common grammar goof-ups.</P>
<P>Moderate mistakes: Noticeable spelling errors or grammar errors.</P>
<P>Major mistakes: Horrible grammar mistakes, failing to follow the character sheets properly.</P>
<P>Blatant Error: Failing to follow the character sheet properly, failing to follow the post previously made accurately. </P>

<P>   <I>Now, this does not mean that a hunter cannot change the course of the RO with a sudden plot twist, it just means that they have to follow the course of the posts made before them. </P>

</I><P>Now, points can be added also, depending on quality. If the post has great story arc, or really well developed character development and story enhancement, then more credits can be awarded… up to 4000 ic’s max.</P>

<P>As always, all the rules of the EH and the BHG have to be upheld at all times during the event. </P>
