<I><FONT SIZE=4><P><U>THE ACTUAL SITE</P></U>
</I></FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<I><U><P>1.1 – REQUIREMENTS:</P>
</I></U>
</B><P>By order of Judicator Ehart Dak`Wind and Specialist Skorbacca, to remain in office a chief of any given kabal must maintain a current, up to date kabal website containing all relevant information pertaining to and deemed necessary by the kabal itself. For a kabal site to be deemed satisfactory, it must pass several tests as listed under section 2.1 – &quot;the scale&quot;. In order to be given the best chance to be accepted by the Specialist, kabal websites should include the following (NB: these are merely examples, and are not to be taken as gospel. There is plenty of room for originality):</P>


<UL>
<LI>An active news page (news script available from cernun.net)</LI>
<LI>A page listing the current hierarchy of the kabal (with the respective contact details for each member listed)</LI>
<LI>An activities site, constantly maintained by the CH and the CRA</LI>
<LI>A links page (linking to both BHG and EH-wide websites)</LI></UL>


<P>Whilst each chief is expected to take care of the website, he/she may enlist the help of their CRA and/or help internal to the kabal (for example, a gifted web designer). If you have any queries regarding this section, please contact the Judicator, Ehart Dak`Wind (<A HREF="mailto:judicator@thebhg.org">judicator@thebhg.org</A>), or the Specialist, Skorbacca (<A HREF="mailto:specialist@thebhg.org">specialist@thebhg.org</A>).</P>

<B><I><U><P>1.2 – OTHER THINGS YOU CAN DO:</P>
</B></I></U>
<P>In addition to the (somewhat) mandatory things listen in section 1.1, there are many other things chief’s and their kabal members can do worth mentioning on the kabal website. For example:</P>


<UL>
<LI>A library, documenting kabal texts/other things important to kabal history or otherwise</LI>
<LI>An archive of CH/CRA reports</LI>
<LI>If &quot;teams&quot; exist within the kabal, links to the respective sites for each &quot;team&quot;</LI>
<LI>A link to the kabal message board, if not already in the links section</LI>
<LI>A current, up-to-date roster of the kabal</LI></UL>


<P>These sort of things will win you favour with the SP/JUD, and will ensure that your mark out of 5 (explained later) is as good as possible. Again, if you have any queries, contact Ehart or Skorbacca for details.</P>

</I>1 – <I>Highly Unsatisfactory<BR>

<P><B>2.2 – Explanation</P>

<I><P>0 – Death Imminent:</P>

</B></I><P>As the name would suggest, if you score this two months in a row, you’ll be approached by the SP and the JUD and questioned as to what is going on, and whether or not you’d like to remain in the job. This site rank means that nothing is happening, and that the site is lying dormant, with no news (or perhaps one every couple of months). No content to speak of, and your roster (if indeed there is one) is two or three months out of date.</P>

<B><I><P>1 – Highly Unsatisfactory</P>

</B></I><P>Again, as the name would suggest, you’re not doing a very good job of maintaining your kabal’s website. Two months of this, and you’ll be answering to the SP/JUD. In order to achieve a mark of one, the CH will have to have done a very laid-back, lazy job of maintaining the site. If news is actually posted, it will be rare, and not very informative or useful. The roster will be fairly out of date, as will the rest of the site.</P>

<B><I><P>2 – Unsatisfactory</P>

</B></I><P>You’ve been a bad girl/boy, and the JUD/SP aren’t particularly happy with your efforts on maintaining your kabal website. Whilst the news you’ve got there is fairly good, you’re only making 3 or 4 posts a month, which is nowhere near enough. You should be making a post every time you get a new member, every time a kabal member goes up in the ranks or receives a medal, or every time a kabal member does something worthy of mention! Your roster is probably out of date, too, which isn’t really acceptable.</P>

<B><I>
<P>3 – Satisfactory</P>

</B></I><P>Your site is adequate, and has been ratified by the SP as being worthy of your CH paycheck. You’ve updated the news page 10-11 times a month (at least), documenting everything from new members to promotions, from medals awarded to members (unfortunately) being promoted to CHs and CRAs elsewhere! Your roster is relatively up to date, but unfortunately, your site hasn’t actually changed much since last month. Be it known, though, that the SP/JUD are still quite happy with the job you’ve done.</P>

<B><I><P>4 – Very Good</P>

</B></I><P>Your kabal website is of a high standard; you’ve implemented many of the things listed as optional but well worth it in the kabal website manual, and your news is updated at least once every couple of days with important information. Not only this, but you’ve made a major update to the content/layout of your site over the past month, which only further demonstrates your activity and dedication to the kabal you lead. Congratulations! You’ve put a smile on your SP/JUDs face.</P>

<B><I><P>5 – Exceptionally Good</P>

</B></I><P>You truly are a shining example of what a chief should aspire to. Not only are you doing everything you should as a chief, you have created a(nother) website for your kabal this month and have updated the news almost every day! Your roster is updated practically every second (or is linked to the database and pulls data straight from there), and you have gone above and beyond the recommended content for the site. You can be sure that the SP/JUD will be approaching you with the prospect of a bonus salary reward for doing such a good job…</P>
