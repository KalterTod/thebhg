</B></U><P>Congratulation on becoming a WARD in the BHG. As you already know, you have been chosen for this position due to you high level of skill. As a WARD there are a number of responsibilities you are to adhere too. These will be listed below. Remember the WARD is the pillar of a Wing. The controlling force and the one who needs to set an example to all of its members. You must be an active member of the BHG and also encourage your members to be just as active. Help them gain in rank, by explaining the numerous ways to earn credits, and encouraging them to do so. Keeping in close contact with your Wing is always a useful way to ensure this. Listed below are you abilities and tasks as a WARD, please complete them with pride. Most of this will be familiar with yourself from sitting the CH course at the Citadel, however a reminder is always for the best.</P>
<B><P>WARD Abilities:</P>
</B><P>As a WARD there are a large number of duties you are capable of. You can run comps for your Wing. You can award medals, and even request credits for the trainees. Listed below are the details on each area. You also receive a monthly salary of 500,000 IC’s + Bonus</P>
<OL>
<B><LI>Credits. </B>If you feel that one of you members deserves a credit reward for what they have done, instead of a medal, then it is possible. However, this is something you are unable to do yourself. When you wish to award any amount of IC's for anything you need to send them to the Judicator/Underlord with you reasons and the amount you wish to add.  This is done by filling in all the required information into the Awarding IC's section of this manual. If the JUD/U feel that it is a just cause then it will be awarded to the hunter. </LI>
<B><LI>Wing Competitions. </B>As a WARD you are free to run whatever competitions you want for your members to take part in. All you need do is to set up the event and then run it. As your members are now to the BHG try to make the hunts a little easier than noramal BHG hunter. Also as the hunts are a little more simple the IC awards should be a little lowwer.  Ask the JUD before hand about the credit rewards if it is to be a new type of hunt otherwise stick to the standard IC awards of 1<SUP>St</SUP> place 30K, other correct 20K, incorrect 10K and no effort, wrong ID 0IC’s. Once the event is over submit the results and IC awards using the Award Credits form as past of this manual to the Judicator and Underlord so the hunters can be awarded their IC’s.  For no reason is a WARD allowed to have other hunters in the BHG creating and running the hunts for them.</LI>
<B><LI>IRC Voice</B>: WARD receive X access of 99 (&amp; Autovoice). While on IRC you need to make sure that you and all other members in the channel follow the EH’s CoC. If not, you will need to report it to a commission member. The Codes of Conduct can be found here: </FONT><A HREF="http://www.emperorshammer.org/irc.htm"><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffffff">http://www.emperorshammer.org/irc.htm</FONT></A></LI></OL>

<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffffff"><P>To get yourself logged onto X, follow these steps:</P>
<OL>

<LI>Go to the CService website and sign up for an account. </FONT><A HREF="http://cservice.undernet.org/live/"><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffffff">http://cservice.undernet.org/live/</FONT></A></LI>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffffff"><LI>Email the Underlord (</FONT><A HREF="mailto:underlord@thebhg.org"><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffffff">underlord@thebhg.org</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffffff">) with your username and wait for confirmation.</LI>
<LI>Join #bhg and use the following command to login to X (this should be added to your "perform" list for ease of use): /msg x@channels.undernet.org login &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;</LI>
<LI>Type "!get commands" in the channel and you will be DCCed a remote script (in mIRC format) that contains all of the X functions you should need. Place this file into "C:/Program Files/mIRC/Scripts/" then in mIRC open your remote scripts, select "Load Script" from the file menu and then choose said file. Once loaded, right click in the channel window and you will see your available commands. </LI></OL>

<B><P>WARD Duties:</P>
</B><P>As said before there are numerous duties, which you are to complete as a WARD. Unlike a CH you do not have someone to pass the duties onto and you are souly responcible for it all.</P>
<OL>

<B><LI>Training</B>: Watching<B> </B>over, assisting and training members of the Wing. Mail out welcoming letters to them when they arrive, give them information about the BHG or tell them where they can find the information. Give them a few ideas on what they can actually do as a member in the BHG. The more helpful and friendly you are to these people, the better chance they have of not going AWOL. </LI>
<B><LI>Report</B>: Produce a weekly Email report. Send to your Wing, JUD, PR, U and W (The commission can be reached with 1 email address, <A HREF="mailto:Reports@thebhg.org"><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffffff">reports@thebhg,org</FONT></A>). It should contain the latest news and events. Perhaps the latest promotions and/or awards within the Kabal, idea's for participation in the BHG, links to various websites or anything else you feel relevant to inform your Kabal about. This is one of the more important tasks. If not adhered to you run the risk of missing out on the monthly bonus.  A template for a weekly report can be found <A HREF=http://ka.thebhg.org/kahunts/report.html Target="new"><B>here</B></A>.  That template id set up for a Kabal, though I'm sure you will be able to alter it just fine.  Once your report has been sent out you also need to post a copy of it on the Holonet. Just log into the admin and it's one of the menu options.  It's important to do this as your bonus is calculated from what is on the Holonet, not the JUD's inbox.</LI>
<B><LI>Wing Website</B>: It is not mandatory that you maintain a Wing website.  We hope that your members will not be at the Citadel for long and will have no need to visit a Wing web site reguarly.  There is a small site for the wings which has a Q&A section as it's main content that You will be responsible for making sure it's up to date.</LI>
<B><LI>Wing Activities</B>: While the BHG provides many activities for members to participate in, often they are not enough to capture members interest over longer periods of time, that is where internal Wing events come into play. Internal Wing events are activities sponsored by the WARD that are exclusive to that Kabal. Such activities are important because they give members something extra to work on and offer another way for members to earn credits. Some ideas for internal Wing events are: <BR>
Web hunts <BR>
Online Mission <BR>
Meeting (on IRC or other chat medium) <BR>
Trivia <BR>
Contests (Graphic/Fiction/Scenario Desc. Etc.)<BR>
Wing Run On Story<BR>
Training Programs <BR>
Just about anything can be used as an event.  As a WARD you'd be highly recommended to have such events frequently to keep your members interested in the BHG. For no reason is a WARD to have other members help them with the running of activities.  If you do choose to have a Kabal Run On Story then you must follow the set rules outlines in the RO manual located <A HREF="http://ka.thebhg.org/manuals/kabal-rp-handbook.html" Target="new"><B>here</B></A>.</LI>
<B><LI>Extras</B>: Take into consideration that these are only the required duties of a WARD. Depending on your style you might take on other things that you want to be responsible for, but these listed above are the things you will be expected to do. These are what give you your paycheque and doing them well is what earns you your bonuses. Remember your bonus is made up from the activities you do throughout the month. All extras are included and also if you carry out your normal duties to a higher level than expected. To qualify for a bonus you must ensure that you do send out a weekly email report to your Kabal and the JUD/PR/U/X (you can mail all 3 with this email address: reports@thebhg.org), which must also be posted on the Holonet.  Run some Kabal activities and make sure you have a few members leave to join a Kabal each month.</LI></OL>
