"I have assembled you all here to discover a murderer," Darth Shadow began, his raspy voice cutting through the silence of the briefing hall. "We have been contracted by Morgal the Hutt to find out who killed four of his henchmen."

Flipping a switch on the podium, your P.A.L lit up with information.

<BR><BR>::::::::<BR><BR>

Two days ago, outside the Lilting Willow, which is one of the seedier bars on Dantooine, four Weequays in the employ of Morgal the Hutt were killed in a manner most savage. The four large aliens were beaten to death in a brawl that started inside the cantina and spilled out into the parking area. 

A lone bounty hunter was rumored to be drinking heavily, apparently silently celebrating something when the Weequay's entered the establishment. As usual, no one in the cantina would talk to the authorities, however the bodies were sent to the coroner for examination. Their report will be available for you upon request.

Morgal has issued a reward for information leading to the capture of the culprit.

<BR><BR>::::::::<BR><BR>

"He believes, based on the above information, that it was a member of our Guild responsible for the deed and is offering a reward for their capture."

"Now, I want this hunter identified, not apprehended! I want to know who he is and more importantly why he was there in the first place." 

"Dismissed," Shadow said with a wave of his hand and left the briefing hall.

<BR><BR>--=={|}==--<BR><BR>

You send in a request for the autopsy report and the neat printed script from the 2-1B droid that examined the bodies.

Species: Weequay; Four subjects

All four subjects suffered major contusions, punctured organs, broken bones and severe blunt trauma standard with multiple pedal contact. Trace amounts of the chemical (C5H8)n found in the trauma wounds seem to confirm this. 

Not all the oxygen transfer fluid found on the bodies was their own, some may have belonged to the attacker. High concentrations of alcohol as well as trace amounts of potato extract and birchwood were found in the discarded fluid.

Coroner Diagnosis: Wrongful Death; Homicide
Analysis of Attacker: Someone skilled in hand to hand combat, above average strength and a being wth a high tolerance to inebriants.

Everything screams out to you who did it, but the mystery of why he was dirtside in a  sleazy place like the Lilting Willow was another. Studying the history of your main suspect, everything falls into place. Not only are your suspicions given credence, but you have a strong suspicion why he was there drinking for in the first place! You hastily type up your report and submit it to the Tactician for review.

So... who do you suspect and why was that person there for?
