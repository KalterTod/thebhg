Hey Slag, Nyk

I know Koral's sent you an e-mail about the news script you guys are using on the Dragon web site, so I won't rehash that. What I will say is that it's up to Dragon whether or not you want to be a part of the new centralised news system. Of course, I think that you should move in that direction, but it's up to you.

If you do stick with the system you're using, your news items won't be shown on the main BHG web site, since it's a different news script. Whether this is a problem or not for you is something for you to decide, but I think it will make Dragon look inactive to the layperson.

Thanks

Jer
