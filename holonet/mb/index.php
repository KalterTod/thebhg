A cold wind nips at your skin as you approach the large teltic iron doors that lead in to one the most respected buildings on Planetoid Cernun, The Medals Hall. Like entering any other building your hunter training takes over and you look for the security system that surely must guard such a holy place, yet you notice no such system. Odd.<br><br>
Upon your approach the iron doors silently swing open and you step into the foyer. You immediately notice the soothing warmth of the interior and that although no lighting tubes can be seen the room is brightly lit. Behind a small desk across from the entrance sits a young man whom you think you recognize but his name escapes you. He looks up from his desk and speaks in a firm but not overpowering voice. 'Your weapons please sir.' When he is satisfied that you are unarmed he allows you to pass through a door that you didn't know was there and into the main hall. <br><br>
You stand at one end of a large rectangular hall with a ceiling so high that it escapes your vision. The hall has been constructed of Tengati Stone (Tengati stone can only be mined from the Black Hole in the Tegati sector, where it takes on the qualities of said black hole and absorbs all light and sound) and is relatively undecorated. The only obtrusions are the four doors and the eight foot tall mirror at the far end.<br><br>
The doors are spaced ten feet apart, two on each side of the hall and are marked by brilliant red holographic symbols that only a trained hunter can decipher. If you can't decipher the symbols you will end up somewhere that your worst nightmares can't even touch, so be confident in your translation before entering. If you can decipher them you will come to no harm and may enter safely.<br><br>
As you near the mirror you realize that it is no ordinary mirror, but a swirling mass of silver liquids that reflects a rough image of yourself. As you stare deeper into the mirror a new image of you begins to take form but, something isn't right, you look somewhat older. As the image settles into a vision of the future you, you can tell that your future will get much, much...<br><br>
